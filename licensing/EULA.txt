patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, trade name, service mark or other 
intellectual property licenses related to the Software by implication, 
estoppel or otherwise. You agree not to remove any copyright notices from

Nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights 
that supersede, the terms of any OSS license.

5.	License to Feedback 
This Agreement does not obligate you to provide Intel with materials, 
information, comments, suggestions, or other communication regarding the 
features, functions, performance, or use of the Software or Intel products 
or services (“Feedback”). To the extent you provide Feedback, you grant 
to Intel and its affiliates a non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicensable, 
irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up and transferable 
license, under all of your intellectual property rights, whether 
perfected or not, to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, 
use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute, import, create 
derivative works of and otherwise exploit any Feedback.

6.	Third Party Software  
Certain third-party software or services mentioned or provided with or 
within the Software may only be used upon securing a license directly 
from the software owner and is subject to further license limitations. 
You acknowledge Intel is not providing you with a license to such 
third-party software and it is your responsibility to directly obtain 
appropriate licenses from such third parties.

7.	No Obligation; No Support 
Intel may make changes to the Software, or items referenced therein, 
at any time without notice. Intel is not obligated to support, update, 
provide training for, or develop any further version of the Software 
or to grant any additional licenses. No agency, franchise, 
partnership, joint venture, or employee-employer relationship is 
intended or created by this Agreement.

8.	EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES 
You acknowledge and agree that downloading, installing and using the 
Software is at your own risk. The Software is provided to you "as is" 
without any express or implied warranty of any kind including warranties 
of merchantability, noninfringement, or fitness for a particular purpose. 
Intel does not warrant the lack of viruses, accuracy or completeness of 
any code, information, text, graphics, links or other items related to

9.	Limitation of Liability 
Use of the OV Software is at your own risk. In no event will Intel or 
its affiliates, licensors, or suppliers be liable for any damages or losses 
whatsoever (including, without limitation, direct, indirect, incidental, 
consequential, or punitive damages or losses of actual or anticipated 
profits, revenue, business, data, information, or privacy) arising out of 
or related to this Agreement or your use or inability to use the Software, 
including any claim for breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligence, 
personal injury or strict liability, even if Intel has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages and whether the losses or damages where 
foreseen, foreseeable, or known. Some jurisdictions prohibit exclusion or 
limitation of liability for implied warranties or consequential or incidental 
damages, so the above limitation may in part not apply to you. The Software 
licensed in this Agreement is not designed or intended for use in any 
medical, lifesaving or life sustaining systems, transportation systems, 
nuclear systems, or for any other mission critical application in which 
the failure of the Software could lead to personal injury or death. 
You may also have other legal rights that vary from jurisdiction to 
jurisdiction. The limited remedies, warranty disclaimer, and limited 
liability are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain 
between Intel and you. You acknowledge Intel would be unable 
to provide the Software without these limitations.

10.	Indemnification
You will indemnify and hold Intel and its affiliates and licensors 
(including their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents) 
harmless against all claims, liabilities, losses, costs, damages, and 
expenses (including reasonable attorney fees), arising out of, directly 
or indirectly, or related to your use of the software or of product 
liability, personal injury or death associated with any unintended 
use of the Software, even if such claim alleges that Intel or an 
Intel affiliate, licensors, or supplier was negligent in the 
design or manufacture of the Software.

11.	Termination and Survival 
At any time, you may terminate this Agreement by uninstalling and 
destroying all copies of the Software. This Agreement will 
automatically terminate and the license from Intel to you will 
immediately end if you violate any term or condition of an Intel 
distribution portal’s Terms of Use where you downloaded the OV 
Software or any term or condition of this Agreement. Intel may 
terminate this Agreement for any reason with thirty (30) days’ 
notice. Upon termination, you must immediately cease using the 
Software and uninstall, delete and destroy all copies of the 
Software licensed from Intel in your possession or control 
and ensure the destruction of all Software licensed from 
Intel in the possession of your agents or contractors. 
All sections of this Agreement, except section 1, 
will survive termination.

12.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction 
This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or relating to 
it will be governed by the laws of the U.S. and Delaware, without 
regard to conflict of laws principles. You agree the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods (1980) does not apply to this Agreement. The state and 
federal courts sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A. will 
have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of 
or relating to this Agreement. You consent to personal 
jurisdiction and venue in those courts. A judgement related 
to this Agreement obtained in a Delaware court may be 
enforced in any court that has jurisdiction.

13.	Assignment 
You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the 
license granted or any of your rights or duties hereunder, 
expressly, by implication, by operation of law, or otherwise 
and any attempt to do so, without Intel’s express prior 
written consent, will be null and void. Intel may assign, 
delegate and transfer this Agreement, and its rights and 
obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.

14.	Entire Agreement; Severability 
The Intel distribution portal’s Terms of Use, the terms 
and conditions of this Agreement, and additional Intel 
license terms in the downloaded text files constitute the 
entire agreement between you and Intel relating to the 
Software, and merge and supersede all related 
discussions and understandings. If any provision of 
this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, the 
other terms and conditions will still be enforceable, 
and the affected provision will be changed and 
interpreted to best accomplish the objectives of such 
provision within legal limits.
